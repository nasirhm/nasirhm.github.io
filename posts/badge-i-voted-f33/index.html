<p>In short, it&rsquo;s what it says in the Description : <em>&ldquo;You participated in Fedora 33 Elections&rdquo;</em>. It is awarded to people who vote in the <a href="https://elections.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Elections</a>.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-fedora-elections-">What are Fedora Elections ?<a href="#what-are-fedora-elections-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Fedora has several elected bodies that regularly conduct elections every release cycle. In addition, Fedora teams can request one-off elections from the Fedora Program Manager when trying to select new leadership or otherwise reach a decision through a formal voting process.</p>
<p>We currently have 3 Open Elections, that takes place every release whenever we have a free seat including:</p>
<ul>
<li>FESCo (Engineering) [Fedora Engineering &amp; Steering Committee]</li>
<li>Mindshare Committee. (Community) [I&rsquo;m running for the Mindshare seat this year too]</li>
<li>Fedora Council.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-the-election-process-works-">How the Election Process works ?<a href="#how-the-election-process-works-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Fedora Implements a <strong>Range voting system</strong>, which works on the principle of allowing voters to rate as many candidates as they want on scale from <code>1</code> to <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>This method is designed to give voters the option of splitting their vote and showing their level of preference of a subset of candidates over another.</p>
<p>Once voting ends, votes are tallied using the summing method (addition of all votes) to generate a final score for a candidate.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-earn-i-voted-fedora-33-">How do I earn &ldquo;I Voted: Fedora 33&rdquo; ?<a href="#how-do-i-earn-i-voted-fedora-33-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Earning <strong>I Voted: Fedora 33</strong> is pretty easy &amp; can be only obtained till <strong>Thursday, December 3rd 2020, 23:59:59 UTC</strong>, The process is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
