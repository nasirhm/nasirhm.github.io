        <p>Recently, I installed NixOS on one of my machines to explore the Nix ecosystem, and to learn how it makes the process of creating deterministic and reproducible builds efficient and simpler.</p>
<p>This blog post series provides an introduction to the Nix package manager and how it works.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-nix">What is Nix?<a href="#what-is-nix" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Nix is a powerful, purely functional package manager designed to be a reliable and reproducible package-management system.</p>
<p>Nix is also the primary package manager for <strong>NixOS</strong> and can also be installed as an additional package manager on Linux and Mac OS X.</p>
<p>It also offers the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic Upgrades and Rollbacks;</li>
<li>Multiple versions of a package;</li>
<li>Multi-user package management, the ability to install certain packages for certain users only;</li>
<li>Effortless setup of build environments for a package, providing functional builds;</li>
<li>and many more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-nix-works">How Nix Works<a href="#how-nix-works" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Packages in the Nix ecosystem are built from Nix expressions, which is a simple functional language that enables the packaging aspect for Nix (The package manager).</p>
<p>A Nix expression describes everything that goes into a package build, e.g: other packages (dependencies), sources, config files, environment variables, external patches, etc.</p>
<p>A Nix expression results in a derivation, which is a build of the expression, that takes some inputs and produces an output, outputs are almost always some <code>/nix/store/some-hash-pkg-name</code> path.</p>
<p>Below is an abstract diagram of how Nix expressions work:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts-static/nix-pkg-101/nix-expression-101.png" alt="How Nix Expressions work"></p>
<p>As you can see, we&rsquo;ve got an application written in C language and we&rsquo;re creating a Nix expression for it, which includes some code patches, dependencies, configurations. The resultant derivation is then created in the Nix Store.</p>
<h3 id="the-essence-of-nix-in-comparison-to-traditional-linux-systems">The essence of Nix in comparison to traditional Linux systems:<a href="#the-essence-of-nix-in-comparison-to-traditional-linux-systems" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Nix emerges from the idea that <strong>FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) is fundamentally incompatible with reproducibility</strong>. Let me explain now:</p>
<p>With traditional Linux systems and package managers, you&rsquo;ll find paths like <code>/usr/bin/python</code> or <code>/lib/libm.so</code> where packages are installed. But there are a lot of things that we don&rsquo;t know about the file that&rsquo;s there, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s the version of the package the binary/library came from?</li>
<li>What are the libraries it uses?</li>
<li>What configure flags were enabled during the build?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions have a significant effect on the resulted build and can also change the behavior of the application.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are ways to get around this in FHS. We can link directly to <code>/lib/libm.so</code> or use <code>/usr/bin/python3.7</code> in our shebang, but then there will still be a lot of unknowns.</p>
<p>Nix plays a pretty essential role in fixing it, by isolating the build itself resulting in reproducible build artifacts.</p>
<p>On Nix systems, the file paths look like this: <code>/nix/store/&lt;hash&gt;-&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re unable to grasp&hellip;No worries! We&rsquo;ll be exploring Nix further in the future with because this is only the first of the series.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading. In the next posts, we will be installing Nix and building some Nix expressions ourselves.</p>
