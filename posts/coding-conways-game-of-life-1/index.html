<p>In the past few days, I&rsquo;ve been exploring mathematics and it&rsquo;s various applications in Computational Theory and User Experience.</p>
<p>In this part one, I&rsquo;ll be looking at Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life from the mathematical perspective and it&rsquo;s application on user experience.</p>
<p>Without any further ado, Let&rsquo;s take a dive into it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-cellular-automata">What is Cellular Automata?<a href="#what-is-cellular-automata" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Cellular Automata is a field of Automata Theory which is a part of Discrete Maths. Automata Theory has applications in Physics, Computational Theory, Biology, etc. Automata Theory consists of the study of various Computational Classes: Combinatorial Logic, Finite-State Machines, Pushdown Automation and Turing Machines.</p>
<p>Cellular Automata deals with Artificial life, which examines systems related to natural life, it&rsquo;s processes, it&rsquo;s evolution, through the usage of simulations with computer models.</p>
<h3 id="cellular-automata---how-">Cellular Automata - How ??<a href="#cellular-automata---how-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Cellular Automata consists of a grid of cells, with discrete (finite states) e.g: On and Off. For each cell a set, a set of cells are called it&rsquo;s neighborhood. It also consists of a set of discrete rules which are applied on each iteration. An initial state (t=0) is selected by defining the state of various cells. Upon each iteration (t+1), The set of rules are applied upon the whole grid and then the change is the state of the neighboring cells is then observed.</p>

<h2 id="conways-game-of-life">Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life<a href="#conways-game-of-life" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life is invented by the famous Mathematician, &ldquo;John Conway&rdquo;. It is also often referred as &ldquo;Life&rdquo;. It is a zero-player game, meaning for it&rsquo;s evolution to be defined by the initial state. It&rsquo;s played on an infinite two-dimentional grid (However, For the sake of computing it, we&rsquo;ll be using an nxn size for the grid).</p>
<p>Each cell has eight neighboring cells which are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.</p>
<p>It consists of the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the rules in action. (GIF for Rules).</p>
<p>Simple, Right ?</p>
<p>It consists of a grid of squares, simple rules and simple states for each cell.</p>
<h3 id="well-youre-in-for-a-treat-patterns">Well, You&rsquo;re in for a treat. Patterns:<a href="#well-youre-in-for-a-treat-patterns" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>There are various patterns (alot !!) that are discovered. However, we&rsquo;ll be looking at some promiment ones below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Still Life</strong>: It&rsquo;s the most obvious pattern we can think of, It&rsquo;s a state of cells, which are stabilized. Where neither cell is producing nor dying out.</li>
<li><strong>Oscillators</strong>: It&rsquo;s another obvious pattern where a set of cells keep oscilating between two states.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple rules, Simple patters, Huh ?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at onther one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spaceships</strong>: A set of cells, which move together in one direction, leaving no traces behind. e.g: Glider (GIF below.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool, Isn&rsquo;t it. How about a Glider generator.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glider Gun</strong>: It&rsquo;s a pattern, which keeps oscilating (like an oscillator) and periodically emits spaceships like the Glider. e.g: Gosper&rsquo;s Glider Gun creating gliders. (GIF).</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm, how about some pattern that leaves some traces behind, Introducing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Puffer</strong>: It&rsquo;s similar to a spaceship, however it leaves the traces behind. (Examples)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-does-it-matter-">Why does it matter ?<a href="#why-does-it-matter-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Conway&rsquo;s game of life is a perfect example to demonstrate how complex behaviour can emerge from simple rules iterated overtime along with providing a simple way to trace back each iteration.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about system design and how often times in order to develop a complex system, simplicity is often neglected. However, with simple rules we can create complex systems.</p>
<p>Thank You for Reading ! Stay tuned, I&rsquo;ll be writing more about it and how to program it in Go Language.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your feedback on the post.</p>
